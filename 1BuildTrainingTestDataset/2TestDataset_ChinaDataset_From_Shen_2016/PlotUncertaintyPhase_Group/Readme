Before run scripts, you should have china topography data. you can download china topography and tectonic data from httpss://gmt-china.org/data
#######  prepare for topography dataset and tectonic dataset  ##########
wget https://gmt-china.org/data/CN-border-L1.dat
wget https://gmt-china.org/data/China_tectonic.dat
mkdir -p  ~/DataSet/China_data
mv CN-border-L1.dat ~/DataSet/China_data/
mv China_tectonic.dat ~/DataSet/China_data/China_tectonic.dat_new
#################################

First, you should run ../3Extract_RealGausian_map_2DCNN_Test.ipynb to obtain ../Output/disp_pg_real 

	
Second, run ./ExtractPhaseGroupVelocityForEachPeriod.ipynb to get each period map

	usage: jupyter-notebook  ./ExtractPhaseGroupVelocityForEachPeriod.ipynb

Third, run ./plotGroupUn.sh ./plotPhaseUn.sh ./plotGroupVs.sh ./plotPhaseVs.sh 

example:
bash ./plotGroupUn.sh 10  # plot group velocity uncertainty at 10s.
bash ./plotGroupVs.sh 10 2.5/3.5 # plot group velocity at 10s with a cpt range of 2.5 km/s to 3.5km/s.  # see the script $1 and $2 for details.
Finally, cd ./Figs; bash combine.sh # combine all plots into one plot.

Filename.txt includes 3260 points for comparison.
