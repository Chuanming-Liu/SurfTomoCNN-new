First, you should run ../3Extract_RealGausian_map_2DCNN_Test.ipynb to obtain ../Output/disp_pg_real 

	
Second, run ./ExtractPhaseGroupVelocityForEachPeriod.ipynb to get each period map

	usage: jupyter-notebook  ./ExtractPhaseGroupVelocityForEachPeriod.ipynb

Third, run ./plotGroupUn.sh ./plotPhaseUn.sh ./plotGroupVs.sh ./plotPhaseVs.sh 

example:

bash ./plotGroupUn.sh 10  # plot group velocity uncertainty at 10s.

Finally, cd ./Figs; bash combine.sh # combine all plots into one plot.

Filename.txt includes 3260 points for comparison.
