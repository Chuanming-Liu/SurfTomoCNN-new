1Extract_dispersion_ph.ipynb   2Extract_dispersion_gr.ipynb

	Using ./Input/InputPhaseData and ./Input/InputPhaseData to generate ./Output/dispersion_ph and ./Output/dispersion_ph
	
	./Output/ includes dispersion curve information of 8-50s for each geographic location.	
	
3Extract_RealGausian_map_CNN_Test.ipynb
	
	Using ./Output/dispersion_ph(and gr) to generate grids containing both phase and group measurements with the same periods for real test.
	
	"./Output/disp_pg_real" is preprocessed test dataset for real prediction.

4Extract_VsLayers_to_syn.ipynb
	
	For comparsion, we also extract China continental Vs results of Shen et al. (2016) to computing theoretical dispersion curves.
	
	Vs results are stored in ./Vs_GroundTruth.

PlotUncertaintyPhase_Group
	
	After run steps of 1-3
	
	cd ./PlotUncertaintyPhase_Group, then plot spatial distribution of dispersion measurements and corresponding uncertainties.
	
MainSmoothResults.m

	this script is used to smooth Vs distribution of each depth slice extracted by "4Extract_VsLayers_to_syn.ipynb" using krig_interp.m.


Note:
	Before you run all scripts, you should prepare for running environment. You shoud install "Anaconda3" and "Basemap".
	
	Basemap   #  https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html
	Anaconda3 #  https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/anaconda/ # for chinese
