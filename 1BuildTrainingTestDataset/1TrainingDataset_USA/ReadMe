	This program is used to Vs models from previous studies to generate training dataset.

Here, we collect Vs models of western USA from Shen et al. (2013) to calculating theoretical

dispersion curves via CPS package (surf96).
 
1. Extract Vs models at depths of 0-150km with each layer thickness of 0.5km.

	cd ./1ExtractVsModelsForGeneratingTrainingDataset
	
	jupyter-notebook Extract_VsLayers_to_syn.ipynb	
	
2. Calculate theoretical dispsersion curves using Vs models from step1.

	cd ./2GenerateTrainingDataset
	
	cd ./0.5km # the layer thickness is 0.5km
    
    cd ./src # 
    
    gfortran -o surfdisp surfdisp_main.f surfdisp96.f #to complie surf96 

    cp surfdisp ../surfdisp # copy program to ../

    - get_rho.m get_vp.m 

        Relationship among Vs, Vp and density from Shen et al. (2013)
    
    - get_rho_vp_cf.m
        
        Relationship among Vs, Vp and density from master thesis of Fei Chen (陈飞)
    
    - plotVsVpmdl_Hermman.m 
        
        Show comparisons of synthetic dispersion curves and observed dispersion curves and corresponding velocity used for forward calculation.

    - surf96.f and surf96_main.f

        the maximum layers you used to do forward calculation must be less than 800.
    
        If your computer memeory is limited, you can modify "NL" and "NLAY" in surfdisp.f and surfdisp_main.f
        
        surfdisp96.f is based on CPS soft package. Huajian Yao modified this file. The default layer number is 50.  

    cd ../
    
    ShenWeiSen_syn_disp.m # run this matlab script to calculate synthetic dispersion curves.

    - disp_out and vs_out
        
        ./disp_out/1_20.5_106.5.txt format (period,phase_vel,group_vel)

            1_20.5_106.5 (perturbation id, latitude, longitude), here we donot use gaussian perturbation.
    
            You can perturb your models by adding gaussian perturbation into reference models to augment your training dataset.

        ./vs_out/1_20.5_106.5.txt format (depth,vs)
    
    Furthre, you use ./2GenerateTrainingDataset/0.5km/Make_gaussian_map.ipynb to generate phase (and group) gaussian map for CNN input during training.

        - you must have anaconda3.4,

    We finally obtain disp_combine_gaussian_map and vs_syn
